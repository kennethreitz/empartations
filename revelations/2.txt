In the stillness of dawn, the breath of God whispers through the trees, caressing each leaf with the tender touch of His infinite love. His light pours forth, not from the sun, but from the heart of the Divine, illuminating the path of righteousness. The faithful walk in this light, their souls adorned with the armor of faith, hope, and love. The heavens sing praises, and the angels stand guard, guiding each step with wisdom. The Spirit moves within, a gentle guide, leading toward eternal peace and unity with the Divine.
