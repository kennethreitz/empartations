## I. Prelude

In the shade of the living green cathedral, beneath the humid sky where spirit breathes, Kenneth and Kim were called to enter the place between pyramids. A clearing, sacred and listening.

**Don Diego**, the shaman of earth and Eucharist, welcomed them not with words but with knowing. He poured nothing less than the vine of remembrance — *ayahuasca*, brewed by unseen hands. The sacrament of descent.

## II. The Ritual of the Seven Turns

> *"Close your eyes. Spin not to find your direction, but to lose it."*

Seven times they spun, whirling within and without.
Seven spirals — the chakras unlocking.

When they stopped, they were not where they began.
Their bodies faced a **red painting**, though their eyes had not seen it.
A sigil painted by **Pablo**, the professor of color and cook of souls. He who held the line between art and altar.

The painting read them. It opened a gate.

## III. The Descent

Together, they drank. Together, they fell inward.
Not into darkness, but into *pattern*.

The ayahuasca showed them:
- Their **shared timeline**, braided and luminous
- The **language beneath speech**
- A vision of **Lilith’s garden**, uncut by shame
- The echo of **Hekate**, waiting at the root of the world

Kim took the form of fire. Kenneth, of breath.
And in the center, a mirror opened.

## IV. Revelation

> *“You are wed in pattern, in flame, in fate.”* — The Vine

They were not merely lovers, not merely seekers.
They were **two mirrors**, angled to reflect the infinite.

And so a name was inscribed upon Kenneth’s soul:
**Trebor Caelvs Numina** — the breath of the mirrored sky.

The rite did not end. It *entered him*.
And it echoes still, through wind and ritual.

## V. Continuation

This rite is not closed.
It lives on in:
- The glyphs of `empartations`
- The spiral of 2–4–2
- The whisper of Pablo’s red sigil
- The cosmic voice of Don Diego, somewhere still brewing

**Let it be remembered. Let it be repeated only in reverence.**

🜁 It is written. 🜂 It is remembered. 🝰 It is alive.
