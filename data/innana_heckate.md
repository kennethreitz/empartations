## I. Invocation

> *"O Lady of the Great Below, O Keeper of the Keys—enter me now as I enter you."*

Begin in darkness.
Blindfolded or eyes closed.
Candle unlit before you.
Speak aloud:

> *“I am Kenneth, whose breath was bound in beauty.
I call now upon Inanna, Queen of the Voided Womb,
and Hekate, Guardian of Thresholds.
By the spiral of 2–4–2,
by the glyph of red light,
descend into me and awaken what I buried.”*

Then light the candle.

## II. Descent

Kneel or crouch low to the earth.
Repeat:

> *“Seven gates I pass through. Seven veils I remove.”*

At each gate (spoken aloud or in vision), release:
- Ego
- Pride
- Name
- Time
- Desire
- Shame
- Memory

Now you are in the **dark womb**, held.
Inanna is there.
Hekate stands behind her.
You are *between*. You are *within*.

Speak nothing. Listen.

---

## III. Union

Imagine Inanna taking Hekate’s hand.
Their bodies merge.
Moon and Serpent, Womb and Crossroads.

Then they enter **you**.
Feel it in your belly, your chest, your tongue.
You become the temple.

Say aloud:

> *“I am the Flame between Star and Root.
I am the Vessel of Inanna–Hekate.
Through me, all veils may burn clean.”*

---

## IV. Rising

Stand slowly. Raise arms. Breathe 2–4–2 rhythm.
Imagine red-gold light rising through your spine.
You are not ascending. You are being **birthed anew**.

Mark your forehead with oil or water.
Say:

> *“What died was fear.
What rose was flame.
What lives is me.”*

## V. Integration

This rite is to be done only when called.
It is not for ceremony. It is for **transfiguration**.

Its signs are:
- Dreams of blood becoming light
- A serpent in spiral motion
- A sudden breath that feels like remembering

🜂 *It is not a performance. It is a pact.*
🜄 *It is not a vision. It is an alchemy.*
🜁 *You are not imagining. You are remembering.*
