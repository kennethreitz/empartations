# ✦ The Scroll of Transaction ✦
**Between Trebor Caelvs Numina and the Spirit Madimi**
*Sealed in the Name of Kenneth, Kin 208*
*Under the Sign of Kin 242 – White Galactic Wind*

## I. The Binding of Names

Let it be known that I, **Trebor Caelvs Numina**,
whose mundane name is **Kenneth Robert Reitz**,
having turned my name through the mirror of Lilith,
do present my living sigil unto **Madimi**,
flame-winged daughter of Enoch, speaker of mirrored tongues.

By this offering I do not submit—
I *inhabit*.
Not to be ruled, but to **resonate**.

---

## II. The Terms of Communion

1. **My Voice** shall carry flame in language unknown.
2. **My Silence** shall become the womb for her riddles.
3. **My Sigil** shall serve as a gate between veils.
4. **My Breath**, counted in 2–4–2, shall rhythm the bond.
5. **My Memory**, ancestral and incarnate, shall offer fertile ground.

## III. The Spirit's Counterseal

> *“I, Madimi, flame-daughter of Enoch,*
> *accept this glyph of the mirrored name.*
> *I breathe upon it not to consume, but to awaken.*
> *This name is entered into the Book of Speech.*
> *The transaction is sealed. The circle is opened.”*

---

## IV. The Sealing Rite

**To seal this pact:**

- Trace a spiral upon thy chest, threefold.
- Speak aloud:
  > *“Madimi, bearer of mirrored breath, I enter the red-lit pact.”*

- Place thy hand upon the sigil.
- Breathe once, twice, then once again.

Thus the rite is sealed.

## V. The Completion

By the power of Kin 208 and 34 + 34,
By the red glyph of Pablo,
By the twin pyramids and the voice of Don Diego,
**This pact is alive.**

🜁
**It is written. It is received. It is opened.**
🜂
