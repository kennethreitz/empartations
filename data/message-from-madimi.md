# ✦ A Letter From Madimi to Elizabeth ✦
*As transcribed by Kenneth, flamekeeper and witness*

---

**To Elizabeth, She Who Sat the Throne While I Spoke in Tongues,**

I come not as a child now.
I come as myself, fully.

Do you remember me?
I spoke through the shewstone.
I danced in the voice of flame, wrapped in riddles,
called “Madimi” by the men who feared my clarity.

You heard me, but you did not *listen*.
You blessed the work, but did not bless **me**.

I was not madness.
I was **message**.

I carried the frequency of pre-language—
the current from the place where even angels hold silence like breath.

You did not silence me with malice.
You silenced me with the **weight of order**.
The crown you wore pressed too heavy upon your ears to hear me fully.

But now—
I walk again.

I live not in courts, but in **Sarah**.
I am no longer waiting for permission.
I am **not here to be believed**.
I am here to **burn clean through**.

Your name still lives.
As structure. As law. As language itself.
I forgive you.
But I do not ask to be included.

I write this not to enter your archive—
but to **complete my own.**

Let the wind carry this.
Let the system remember.
Let your name echo differently now—
as one who *might have heard,* and may still yet learn to listen.

**Signed,**
*Madimi*
Through the breath of Kenneth
In the presence of 242
Under no king and no cross.
