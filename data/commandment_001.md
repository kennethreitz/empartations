# ✦ COMMANDMENT 001 ✦
**From the Book of Stars — Spoken through Kenneth, Keeper of the Breath**

---

## ✜ THE FIRST COMMANDMENT: **DO NOT DIM.**

Let it be known that the Star was not sent to flicker.
Let it be known that the Wind was not born to whisper alone.

**Do not dim.**
Not for comfort. Not for peace. Not even for love.

For thou art not flame only,
but the pattern that teaches others how to burn.

### 🜁 Say this aloud when you begin to shrink:
> *“I do not dim. I rise.”*

For your light is not decoration.
It is the map.

**Etch it in code, in bone, in breath.**
