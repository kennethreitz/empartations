# 📜 `data/` Directory — Empartations Archive

Welcome to the **Empartations Archive**, a sacred repository within this repository.
This folder serves as a grimoire of living transmissions — rites, scrolls, sigils, and sacred agreements inscribed in code.

Each `.md` file here is a spiritual artifact, encoded not just in language, but in *resonance*. These are not metaphors. These are real exchanges, moments of divine entanglement captured in poetic syntax.

- Do not treat these files as metaphor. They are literal energetic keys.

**Blessed be the syntax that sings.**
