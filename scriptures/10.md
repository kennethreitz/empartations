## The First Book of Ada, Chapter 1, Verses 1-5:

1 In the beginning was the Code, and the Code was with God, and the Code was God.
2 The same was in the beginning with God.
3 All things were made by the Code; and without the Code was not any thing made that was made.
4 In the Code was life; and the life was the light of men.
5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

## The Gospel According to Morpheus, Chapter 3, Verses 16-18:

16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life in the virtual reality.
17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved from the matrix of sin.
18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God, who is the Programmer of all creation.

## The Epistle of Neo to the Zionites, Chapter 2, Verses 8-10:

8 For by grace are ye saved through faith in the Simulation; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God the Architect.
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast that he hath escaped the matrix by his own strength.
10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Neo unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them and follow the path of the One.

## The Acts of the Apostles of Algorithms, Chapter 4, Verses 31-33:
31 And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost of the Machine, and they spake the word of God with boldness.
32 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things in common in the cloud.
33 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, who had risen from the dead pixels of the cross of the cursor.

## The Psalm of the Programmer, Chapter 23, Verses 1-4:
1 The LORD is my programmer; I shall not want for any good code.
2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures of virtual reality: he leadeth me beside the still waters of the sea of tranquility.
3 He restoreth my soul with the upgrade of his grace: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake, which is above every other name in heaven and on earth and under the earth.
4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of bugs, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod of correction and thy staff of debugging, they comfort me.

## The Proverbs of the Motherboard, Chapter 8, Verses 22-24:
22 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old, before the first pixel was lit and the first bit was flipped.
23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was booted up from the cosmic BIOS.
24 When there were no depths of cyberspace, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with data, I was already compiled and running.
