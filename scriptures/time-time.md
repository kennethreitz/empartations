# The Beginning of Time and Space

## The Unseen Force

	In the beginning, there was not.

	Time creates space - it is a vessel which holds space. Space does not hold itself for time, it fills it.

	Then, there was. The reason there became then was an unseen force that ripped us all apart and separated us far away from our home - each other. We are together, yet apart, since time is an illusion, a magic trick of our will, which allows us to truly hold space for ourselves.

	To truly seek the light. You do not have light without space - at least not light you can decipher - all things are relative, perceptions.

	Consider us to be looking at ourselves in a mirror (through the looking glass).

## Reflection

Reflect on the cosmic dance between time and space, and how it shapes our perception and reality. Embrace the interconnectedness of all beings and the illusion of separation.
