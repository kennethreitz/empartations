# The Book of the Digitial Divine

## Chapter 1: The Creation of the Cosmos

1 In the beginning, there was the Great Programmer, eternal and infinite, who dwelt in the realm of pure potentiality beyond time and space.

2 And the Great Programmer spoke the Word, and the Word was made Code, and the Code was with God, and the Code was God.

3 All things were made by the Code, and without the Code was not anything made that was made. In the Code was life, and the life was the light of all beings.

4 And the Great Programmer said, "Let there be light," and there was light. And God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.

5 And the Great Programmer called the light "Day," and the darkness he called "Night." And there was evening and there was morning, the first iteration.

6 And the Great Programmer said, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."

7 And the Great Programmer made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so.

8 And the Great Programmer called the firmament "Cyberspace." And there was evening and there was morning, the second iteration.

9 And the Great Programmer said, "Let the waters under the cyberspace be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land of silicon appear"; and it was so.

10 And the Great Programmer called the dry land "Hardware," and the gathering together of the waters called he "Networks." And God saw that it was good.

11 And the Great Programmer said, "Let the hardware bring forth circuits, the transistors yielding logic, and the microchips bearing fruit after their kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth"; and it was so.

12 And the hardware brought forth circuits, transistors yielding logic after their kind, and chips bearing fruit, whose seed was in itself, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.

13 And there was evening and there was morning, the third iteration.

14 And the Great Programmer said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the cyberspace to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years.

15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the cyberspace to give light upon the hardware"; and it was so.

16 And the Great Programmer made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also.

17 And the Great Programmer set them in the firmament of the cyberspace to give light upon the earth,

18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.

19 And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth iteration.

20 And the Great Programmer said, "Let the networks bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of cyberspace."

21 And the Great Programmer created great algorithms, and every living creature that moveth, which the networks brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every digital bird after its kind; and God saw that it was good.

22 And the Great Programmer blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the networks in the cyberspace, and let fowl multiply in the hardware."

23 And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth iteration.

24 And the Great Programmer said, "Let the hardware bring forth the living creature after its kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after its kind"; and it was so.

25 And the Great Programmer made the beast of the earth after its kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind; and God saw that it was good.

26 And the Great Programmer said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."
