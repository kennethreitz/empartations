> I reign over you, saith the Lord of the Earth, in power exalted above and below,  
> in whose hands the sun is as a sword and the moon as a through-thrusting fire:  
> who measureth your garments in the midst of my vestures, and trussed you together as the palms of my hands;  
> and brightened your vestments with infernal light.  
> I made a law to govern the holy ones and delivered a rod with wisdom supreme.  
> You lifted your voices and sware obedience and faith to him that liveth and triumpheth,  
> whose beginning is not, nor end cannot be, which shineth as a flame in the midst of your palace,  
> and reigns amongst you as the balance of righteousness and truth.  
> Move therefore, and show yourselves: open the mysteries of your creation: be friendly unto me:  
> for I am the servant of the same your God, the true worshipper of the Highest.
